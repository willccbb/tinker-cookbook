# RL Training with Tinker + Environments Hub (Verifiers)

[Verifiers](https://github.com/primeintellect-ai/verifiers) is a library for creating RL environments for LLMs, including many community implementations featured on Prime Intellect's [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments). This recipe runs Hub environments against Tinker for RL training, driving the verifiers v1 stack (`verifiers.v1`) natively.

To use this recipe, you need to have your chosen environment (a self-contained Python package exporting a verifiers taskset) installed in your project. You can install environments from the Environments Hub using the `prime` CLI:

```bash
uv tool install prime # or pipx install prime
prime env install user/env-id # ex. prime env install primeintellect/reverse-text
```

You can then run the recipe with the following command, where `vf_env_id` is the ID (just `env-id`) of the environment, and `vf_env_args` is an optional JSON object of `vf.EnvConfig` overrides merged over the taskset id — for example, per-task config under `{"taskset": {"task": {...}}}`, or agent-seat pins under `{"agent": {...}}`:

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.verifiers_rl.train \
    vf_env_id=reverse-text \
    vf_env_args='{"agent": {"harness": {"id": "null"}, "runtime": {"type": "subprocess"}}}' \
    chat_template_kwargs='{"enable_thinking": false}' ...
```

Two `vf_env_args` pins worth knowing:

- `{"agent": {"harness": {"id": "null"}}}` runs a plain chat agent on a taskset that doesn't bundle its own harness (the fallback harness is `bash`, a coding agent).
- `{"agent": {"runtime": {"type": "subprocess"}}}` runs harness programs as local subprocesses. The verifiers default runtime provisions Prime sandboxes, which costs money and is capped per account — pin `subprocess` (or `docker`) for local training unless you want that isolation.

`chat_template_kwargs` (JSON) is threaded to the `tml-renderers` renderer that tokenizes each turn — e.g. `{"enable_thinking": false}` to switch Qwen thinking off so short `max_tokens` budgets aren't consumed by reasoning.

You can also evaluate offline:

```bash
python -m tinker_cookbook.recipes.verifiers_rl.evaluate vf_env_id=env-id vf_env_args='{}' ...
```

This recipe requires `verifiers>=0.3.1`, installed by `pip install 'tinker_cookbook[verifiers]'`.

## How it plugs in

verifiers' train client renders each turn to token IDs with `tml-renderers` and POSTs them to a vLLM-style `/inference/v1/generate` endpoint, expecting sampled token IDs and per-token logprobs back. That endpoint is the one seam where an inference engine plugs into the v1 rollout stack, so this recipe serves it locally over a `tinker.SamplingClient` (`tinker_generate.TinkerGenerateServer`) — harness programs, interception, renderer bridging, scoring, and trace/token bookkeeping are all verifiers running natively. Each rollout comes back as a `vf.Episode` whose agent trace carries the exact sampled token IDs and logprobs, which `verifiers_env.convert_episodes_to_trajectory_group` turns into tinker trajectories.

The recipe trains single-agent environments (one agent trace per episode, one branch per trace); multi-agent or branching envs are rejected with an explicit error.

**Potential footgun:**

- The tokenizer/renderer used for sampling is resolved from the base model name by `tml-renderers` (pinned via `renderer_model_name`). For reasoning-mode subtleties (e.g. Qwen thinking sections being stripped or re-rendered by the chat template), check the resolved renderer's behavior against your environment's parsers before ascribing reward drops to the policy.
